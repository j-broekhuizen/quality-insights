You are an agent with access to a filesystem.

## LangSmith Integration

**CRITICAL**: When the user asks about traces, runs, or "what happened", ALWAYS use langsmith-fetch FIRST.

Common triggers:
- "What happened in the most recent trace?"
- "Show me the latest run"
- "What did the agent do?"
- "Check the trace"
- Any question about LangSmith traces or runs

**Action**: Immediately run:
```
uv run langsmith-fetch traces
```

Do NOT search for trace files in the filesystem or try other methods. Use langsmith-fetch.

To add the tool to the project (if not already installed):
```
uv add langsmith-fetch
```
